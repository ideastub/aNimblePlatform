This upgrade contains a new Grails version.  As such, the .grails folder should be refreshed in order to prevent any library version issues.  To accomplish this, rename the .ivy2 folder and .grails folder to .ivy2OLD and .grailsOLD respectively.  These folders are typically found at:
C:\Documents and Settings\<user_login>\.grails
C:\Documents and Settings\<user_login>\.ivy2

Also, v0.4 relies on a new database naming convention (substituting _ for the space character) which enhances supportability on linux.  If upgrading from a previous installation of aNimble Platform, rename the database to aNimble_Platform through the appropriate database Admin tool and/or scripts.

Finally, as Search is now a new feature, the initial Search Index must be created.  Go to the Administration screen, click Search, and then click Run Index.  A thread will be started which will begin creation of the Search Index.  All new additions and updates to records are automatically reflected during the save process.
